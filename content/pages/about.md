Title: About
Slug: about

Hi! I'm Francis Lee. I'm a computational biologist, synthetic biologist, and software engineer living in Boston. My primarily interests are in biological architecture, sailing, and code.

I currently work at [Elucidata](http://www.elucidata.io/) where I build software tools for novel methods in imaging and spectral analysis. Prior to this, I spent time as a Visiting Scientist at the [Wyss Institute](https://wyss.harvard.edu/), where I worked on protein design. I have also spent time building open-source hardware for biology at [Opentrons](www.opentrons.com), and built the first biofoundry at [Ginkgo Bioworks](www.ginkgobioworks.com).

In my spare time, I spend quite a bit of time dwelling in concepts of inference in biology, biological design, the future of biotechnology, as well as the future of our biology. You can also catch me planning my future sailing voyage across the Atlantic, as well as my future sprinter van conversion.

I built this site as a way to collect my thoughts, research, and resources; I hope they may prove useful to others.

Read my [Project Page](https://www.francisglee.com/projects.html) or my [CV](#work-experience) below to get to know me a bit better, or email and say hi. Other ways to connect are linked at the bottom of the page as well.
