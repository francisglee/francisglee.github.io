Title: About
Slug: about

Hi! I'm Francis Lee. I'm a software engineer, data scientist, and synthetic biologist living in Boston. My primarily interests are biological architecture, sailing, and code.

I currently work at [Elucidata](http://www.elucidata.io/). Prior to this, I spent time as a Visiting Scientist at the [Wyss Institute](https://wyss.harvard.edu/), where I worked on protein design. In my spare time, ... You can also catch me daydreaming about my future sprinter van conversion.

Read my [Project Page](https://www.francisglee.com/projects.html) or my [CV](#work-experience) below to get to know me a bit better, or email and say hi.
